# open-archive.org

This is the Jekyll site for the open-archive.org website (hosted by GitHub pages)

This is a fairly standard Jekyll site, based on the [Landing Page Theme](README-theme.md)

As you can see, the site is currently only a single page, and it could use a lot more content.

Technically the site is hosted on GitHub pages and SSL termination is done by Cloudflare.
