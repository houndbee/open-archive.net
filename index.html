<p>Welcome!</p>

<p>With generous support from the Knight Foundation and in collaboration with the Guardian Project and the Committee to Protect Journalists, we are excited to launch OpenArchive. It is a free, open-source mobile application for those concerned with privacy, provenance, and preservation of their media. Currently available for android, its features include: adding metadata and creative commons licensing and sending media to the Internet Archive over Tor.</p>

<p> Citizens armed with mobile devices are becoming history’s first responders, amassing rich, contextualized, and crucial records of today’s breaking news. Open Archive is a free, open-source mobile application that allows journalists, citizen documentarians, and researchers to securely route, store, and safeguard this material in a collection at the Internet Archive. Much of this material currently resides on social media platforms that can chill free speech and are subject to government censorship, privacy concerns, and data loss. With its users’ participation, Open Archive fosters a virtual commons where civil liberties are protected, in the process creating a world where the people’s history is a primary history.</p>
