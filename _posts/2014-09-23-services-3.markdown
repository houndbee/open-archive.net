Open Archive allows journalists, citizen documentarians, and researchers to securely route, store, and safeguard their material in a collection at the Internet Archive.

Much of this material currently resides on social media platforms that can chill free speech and are subject to  government censorship, privacy concerns, and data loss.

With its users' participation, Open Archive fosters a virtual commons where civil liberties are protected, in the process creating a world where the peopleâ€™s history is a primary history.
