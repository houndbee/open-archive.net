Open Archive routes, stores, and safeguards mobile media in user-created collections at the Internet Archive. It aims to securely preserve media captured by journalists, citizen documentarians, and the public at large.

Much of this material currently resides on social media platforms that can chill free speech and are subject to  government censorship, privacy concerns, and data loss. We are doing better.

With its users' participation, Open Archive fosters a virtual commons where civil liberties are protected, in the process creating a world where the peopleâ€™s history is a primary history.
